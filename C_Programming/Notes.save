1. String literal concatenation

Adjacent string literals are concatenated at compile time; this allows long strings to be split over multiple lines, and also allows string literals resulting from C preprocessor defines and macros to be appended to strings at compile time:

    printf(__FILE__ ": %d: Hello "
           "world\n", __LINE__);

will expand to

    printf("helloworld.c" ": %d: Hello "
           "world\n", 10);

which is syntactically equivalent to

    printf("helloworld.c: %d: Hello world\n", 10);
